# Bootstrap-Portfolio

# Description

Following my design and development of a portfolio webpage using flex-box and css grid, I was tasked with using the Bootstrap CSS Framework to build my portfolio layout. I used Bootstrap to create a navbar, jumbotron and 

# Portfolio sections

The portfolio presents my name, avatar and a navigation bar which links to sections about me, my work and contact information. Within the section entitled work there are titled images of my applications, which when clicked on link the user to the deployed application. The webpage has been designed to have a responsive layout and is adaptable, being able to be viewed on a range of different screen sizes.
