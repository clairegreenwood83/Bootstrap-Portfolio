# Bootstrap-Portfolio

# Description

Following my design and development of a portfolio webpage using flex-box and css grid, I was tasked with using the Bootstrap CSS Framework to build my portfolio layout. The project specification is detailed below:

## Project Specification

Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:
The website should include the following bootstrap components:


- A Navigation bar
- A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use bootstrap's navbar or create your own.
- Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
- Links should navigate to the appropriate sections

- A hero section
- A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

- A work section
- A section displaying your work in grid.
- If you need to use placeholder image use: https://placehold.co/
- Use bootstrap cards for each project.
- The description should give a brief overview of the work.
- Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

- A skills section
- List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

- An about / contact section.
- An "About Me" section in the same row.

- A footer section.

- All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
- All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

- Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
- Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.


# Portfolio sections

The portfolio displays a navigation bar which links to sections about me, my work and contact information. The navigation bar contains a navigation menu developed using a Bootstrap navbar. Following this is a hero section which contains a jumbotron displaying my name, avatar and welcome message. Below this is a section entitled work where there are titled images of applications I have made, which when clicked on link the user to the deployed application. This section was developed utilising Bootstrap cards. Following this is a section detailing the skills I aim to acquire from the Bootcamp course I am currently undertaking. A contact section was designed using code for a contact form from Formspree (https://formspree.io/), this allows users to fill in their details and submit a form which will then be sent to my email inbox. A footer section displays icons from fontawesome (https://fontawesome.com/), which link to a new email page (mailto link), my GitHub homepage and my Linkedin homepage (still to be set up) respectively. All hyperlinks have been designed to have a hover effect and buttons have a box shadow effect on hover. The webpage has been designed to have a responsive layout and is adaptable, being able to be viewed on a range of different screen sizes. Due to the use of Bootstrap the use of media queries has been significantly reduced. Following its completion the webpage was then deployed to GitHub Pages.
