# Portfolio sections

The portfolio displays a navigation bar which links to sections about me, my work and contact information. The navigation bar contains a navigation menu developed using a Bootstrap navbar. Following this is a hero section which contains a jumbotron displaying my name, avatar and welcome message. Below this is a section entitled work where there are titled images of applications I have made, which when clicked on link the user to the deployed application. This section was developed utilising Bootstrap cards. Following this is a section detailing the skills I aim to acquire from the Bootcamp course I am currently undertaking. A contact section was designed using code for a contact form from Formspree (https://formspree.io/), this allows users to fill in their details and submit a form which will then be sent to my email box. A footer section displays icons from fontawesome (https://fontawesome.com/), which link to a new email page (mailto link), my GitHub homepage and my Linkedin homepage (still to be set up) respectively. All hyperlinks have been designed to have a hover effect and buttons have a box shadow effect on hover. The webpage has been designed to have a responsive layout and is adaptable, being able to be viewed on a range of different screen sizes. Due to the use of Bootstrap the use of media queries has been eliminated. Following its completion the webpage was then deployed to GitHub Pages.
